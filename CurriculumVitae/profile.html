        <h4>Good Problem-solving skills, including the following:</h4>
        <p>
            Throughout the 17 years working at Supermac`s I have learned a lot of new skills. 
            There are different positions at work that require different sets of skills. 
            There is a position at the grill: I have learned communication- essential for that position. 
            Front: up-sale, dealing with customer issues and problems, explaining the menu and different options, organizing big event orders. 
            Lobby area: conversations with customers, assistance, even learned to deal with stressful situations where customers would be in danger or need medical attention. 
            Pizza area: teamwork. Orders coming in and out, change in the orders, cancelations. 
            Management skills: making sure we are always in stock, orders done on time, areas checked through the workday, and organized cleaning. 
            I am self-motivated and always enthusiastic about work and I get satisfaction from a job well done.
        </p>
        <h4>Thirst for knowledge and education:</h4>
        <p>
            From the start in Cregana, I've learned so much, and never turned an unread page of information given to me, Brain is a weird mechanism where information can be remembered in the weirdest situations given so sometimes even if I don't understand all of the information it is a great practice to get it in my system.  In some positions, I was presented at my training, While waiting for the instructor, I got glims of a lot of processes related to product development steps and procedures required for the job to be done superbly.
