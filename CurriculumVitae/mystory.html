        I was born in Lithuania. Grew up in Kaunas, the main street of the second-biggest town in the country. 
        My mother was born there before me. She finished the highest school of computer programming at that time. 
        While working with one of the first computers, she was telling stories about how massive they were and how she used to write algorithms for them to function. 
        At a turn of events, she ended up in a bad situation in life, where she was working a simple labor job, while a single mother raising me. 
        At the age of 20, just after ending school, I got a great opportunity to go to Ireland where I got my first job in Supermac`s.
        I worked there for 16 years. It was a hard job but I learned a lot of great skills. 
        It was handy because it was close to home so I could spend more time with my family. 
        </p>

            At the age of 23, I was blessed with my daughter Madelyne. 
            She filled my life with purpose. Later at school, 
            Madelyne was very independent and a great student with very high grades. 
            Every teacher loved her.

            Life was nice and easy but I was missing a hobby, something related to riddles, rebuses, and logic tasks. 
            I loved algebra at school but I could never find anything that I could invest my time in. I used to search for courses online but they all looked so complicated. 
            It was hard to pick something when I wasn`t even sure what I wanted to do with my life.

            When covid-19 hit, my workplace was closed and I got a lot of time for myself. While I was browsing the internet, I came across the Code Institute program “5 Day Challenge”. 
            That was my very first encounter with code. I loved it since the start. Afterwards, I found projects online to follow and learned a bit about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>

            In August of 2020, my daughter Madelyne was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. She was seizing and nearly died. 
            A month after that, my mother who lived with us since Madelynes birth was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer at 74 years old, with a half-year expectance to live. `
            It was very overwhelming.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2022 February I started the Code Institute program “Diploma in Software Development (E-commerce Applications)”. 
            Finally found my passion in life. It helped me to gain my confidence and express the pain of my losses. It reminded me of happy times, helping me to escape from reality. 
            To rest and to appreciate daily life. 
            Code empowered me with problem-solving, and finding solutions. The longer time I spent problem-solving, the bigger satisfaction (or laughter if it was a silly mistake).
        </p>

            Over the last couple of years I understood how important my life experience was in Supermac`s even though it seemed meaningless at times. Especially for coding. 
            It taught me patience, communication skills, organization on time, and correct products. 
            The sense of time. Many painful experiences. A lot of failure, with orders flowing and you being unprepared for them. 
            Unexpected groups of teens from discos and learning how to react fast. 
            Teamwork played a big role in all of that and learning how to work with different types of people throughout those 16 years. 
            Training them and helping to understand the same tasks in different ways. 
            Got to know many different people from different cultures, including Irish, Lithuanians, Polish, Romanians, Brazilians, Indians, Pakistani, and Czech Republicans.
