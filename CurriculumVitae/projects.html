        <h3>Portfolio 4 for Code Institute</h3>
        <a href="https://github.com/gretazas/inspa" target="_blank">"Inspas"- inspitational post page</a>
        <p>
            For this page, my biggest inspiration was my daughter. <br>
            She was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes summer of 2020 and after that, she had severe anxiety. <br>
            The site's idea is to share different great ideas in different aspects of life. <br>
            This was the first time I used Django, it was very difficult to get around it.

        <h3>Portfolio 3 for Code Institute</h3>
        <a href="https://github.com/gretazas/pyramid" target="_blank">Pyramid Game</a>
        <p>
            I loved this portfolio the most because it brought great memories about my mother. we used to play this game
            together.<br>
            I never came across this game anywhere in the internet, so it is very unique. <br>
            I have tried to google search for rules, just to check if it would be similar to my mother`s version, but
            couldn`t find this type of game at all.

        <h3>Portfolio 2 for Code Institute</h3>
        <a href="https://github.com/gretazas/black_jack_game" target="_blank">Black Jack Game</a>
        <p>
            This portfolio was very exciting, I love JavaScript. <br>
            I love riddles in general, which is why I loved the experience I have gained with this portfolio.

        <h3>Portfolio 1 presented for Code Institute</h3>
        <a href="https://github.com/gretazas/portfolio_1" target="_blank">Play with Algi kids party planner</a>
        <p>
            This portfolio was my first ever created website, I had a minimal experience with HTML and CSS. <br>
            I like spending time with kids so the project was close to my heart. <br>
            I imagined if I would have a similar business that would be the kind of website I would like to have.
