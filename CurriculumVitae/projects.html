    <h1>Projects in GitHub</h1>

    <h3>Portfolio 1 presented for Code Institute</h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/gretazas/portfolio_1">Play with Algi kids party planner</a>
    <p>This portfolio was my first ever created website, I had a minimal experience with HTML and CSS. 
        I like spending time with kids so the project was close to my heart. 
        I imagined if I would have a similar business that would be the kind of website I would like to have.

        This portfolio was very exciting, I love JavaScript. 
        I love riddles in general, which is why I loved the experience I have gained with this portfolio.

    <h3>Portfolio 3 for Code Institute</h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/gretazas/pyramid">Pyramid Game</a>
    <p>
        I loved this portfolio the most because it brought great memories about my mother. we used to play this game together.
        I never came across this game anywhere in the internet, so it is very unique. 
        I have tried to google search for rules, just to check if it would be similar to my mother`s version, but couldn`t find this type of game at all.
